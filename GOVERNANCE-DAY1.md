## 📘 Executive Summary

This **Day 1 Governance Document** sets the foundational principles, roles, and responsibilities that define how our fintech startup will manage data, enforce trust boundaries, and ensure platform integrity across our payment, citizen-data, and open-source functions.

Operating in both **U.S. and EU jurisdictions**, we embrace a **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** from the outset. No actor—internal or external—is trusted by default.

This document is issued as a **living policy**, with space for **Day 30 and Day 90 updates**, and addendums reflecting evolving compliance landscapes.
