# üõ°Ô∏è Founder's Flight Deck ‚Äì Governance README (Simulated)

**Issued By:** Erwin Maurice McDonald
**Title:** Chief Information Officer (Simulated)
**Effective Date:** 2025-07-26
**Document Version:** v1.0-simulated
**Audience:** Internal Developers, Partner Stakeholders, Governance Advisors

> **Purpose:** This document simulates the governance blueprint for the "Founder's Flight Deck ‚Äì Day 1" RShiny dashboard platform, which includes modules across three regulated sectors: Defense, Fintech, and Nonprofit. It outlines principles for data trust, sector-specific compliance, and third-party collaboration as part of a resilient, policy-aware architecture.

## üß≠ Governance Strategy Overview

### 1. üìå Defense Module ‚Äì Zero Trust Compliance (NIST 800-207)

* Access governed by Zero Trust principles
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA), endpoint hardening, and behavioral analytics
* Requires logging of every action and immutable audit trails
* Enforced segmentation between frontend display and backend computation

### 2. üí≥ Fintech Module ‚Äì Regulatory + Ethical AI Trust

* Compliance with: U.S. SEC, CFPB, GDPR (EU), PSD2
* Model transparency + fairness scoring
* Continuous risk monitoring on customer-facing outputs
* Encrypted API interactions via OAuth2 and tokenized audit checkpoints

### 3. üåê Nonprofit Module ‚Äì Collaborative Oversight Trust

* Limited-access third-party data contributors (NGOs, donors, research partners)
* Collaborative datasets anonymized via pseudonymization strategies
* Periodic reviews of stakeholder access scopes
* Use of `read-only` API keys for most external entities

## üîÅ Cross-Sector Risk Tiering

| Sector    | Trust Level | Risk Tier | Controls                      |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Defense   | Zero Trust  | High      | MFA, SIEM, NIST 800-207       |
| Fintech   | Conditional | Moderate  | GDPR, AI Fairness Logs        |
| Nonprofit | Cooperative | Minimal   | Data Use Agreements, DUA Logs |

---

## üîê Authentication + Access Control

* Tiered permissions: Viewer, Contributor, Auditor, Admin
* Default user role: Viewer
* Privileged roles require ticketed elevation + re-verification
* All modules protected via role-based access tokens (RBAC)

## üìÅ Collaboration Policies

* Each third-party must sign and acknowledge:

  * Acceptable Use Guidelines
  * Dataset Retention + Disposal Schedules
  * Model Interpretation Disclosure Expectations

* Read access granted for 90-day terms, with automated review notices

* No write access without dual sign-off from Legal and Data Stewards
